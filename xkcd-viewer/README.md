#  xkcd-viewer

A simple app for viewing the most recent [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com)
Was sitting on the app from a while ago. Written to learn Swift and SwiftUI.

TODO (if i get to it):
+ a badge to notify user of a new unread comic
+ button for loading a random comic
+ less janky tooltips that won't ghost
